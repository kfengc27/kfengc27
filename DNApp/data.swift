This was a signal that DN is taking a direction on it's own post LayerVault. I wasn't used to it yet as I was still adjusting to the new environment like walking in my favourite store to see what's new. \n\nSo I went through the each link, trying to find out what has changed and what is different, and I found some cool stuff along with couple of things that needs ironing out. Posted my feedback about it and went about my day. Came back a few hours later, saw some of the bugs have been fixed. Wow, talk about quick response! Pretty excited about the team taking this forward. \n\nThen I came back this morning and was reading through some of the comments and reaction. My heart sank a little as there were a lot of negativity about the redesign (along with lots of good ones too). I can strongly relate to this situation.\n\nProfessionally, this happens too and it is something I can stay objective on, but I felt DN is closer to home on a personal level. Designing for designers is like baking for pastry chefs, they can be extremely critical about it because they value their craft and do tend to strive for perfection. Sometimes we forget why we do what we do beyond all that perfection… \n\nDN is a place for us designers to get together, share insightful ideas, news and experiences amongst many other way we connect. It is a community about sharing, and we do it with decency. That's why the quality of the content has always been so good. \n\nIf you want to share your feedback, be nice. Be constructive and hold the snark. Help the team behind this who manage to keep this community free and open to make it better. Do what you want others to do for you. \n\nGive the team behind this a big pat in the back. They are doing an amazing job trying to take in all the feedback. Let them have some time to take where they envision this. \n\n**Big thanks to** \n[Andrew](https://twitter.com/awilkinson) \n[Max](https://twitter.com/maxlind) \n[Jody](https://twitter.com/jodyheavener) & \n[Farzad](https://twitter.com/farzadban)\n\n*P.S* If you really really dislike the new design and want your own flavour, then go try out something like [stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) to customise your own DN with your own CSS.",
